# Flu-Shot-Learning-Predict-H1N1-and-Seasonal-Flu-Vaccines

In this challenge, we will look at vaccination, a key public health measure used to combat infectious diseases. Vaccines provide immunisation to individuals, and sufficient immunisation in a community can further reduce the spread of disease through ‘herd immunity’.

This issue examines the public health response to a recent major respiratory disease pandemic. In early spring 2009, a pandemic caused by the H1N1 influenza virus, colloquially called ‘swine flu’, spread around the world. Researchers estimate that in the first year, it was responsible for between 151,000 and 575,000 deaths worldwide.

In October 2009, a vaccine against the H1N1 influenza virus was made available to the public. In late 2009 and early 2010, the United States conducted the 2009 National H1N1 Influenza Survey. This telephone survey asked respondents whether they had received the H1N1 and seasonal flu vaccines, along with questions about themselves. These additional questions covered their social, economic and demographic background, their views on disease risks and vaccine effectiveness, and their behaviours to mitigate transmission. A better understanding of how these characteristics are associated with personal vaccination patterns may provide guidance for future public health initiatives.
